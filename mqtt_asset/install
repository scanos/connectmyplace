Intall MYSQL and MQTT on a Raspberry Pi (For proof of concept use test as both the user name and password for the MQTT broker - harden this when you bring this into production) 
Download this git which contains devices.sql,mqtt mqtt_basic.sh and mqttclient.sh
Within the MYSQL console create a database , say test.
On the Linux command line CLI , run sudo mysql test < devices.sql (This creates an empty table devices within the mysql test database)

Next, run the following command in one window of the Pi - mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t '#' -u test -P test -v | ./mqtt_basic.sh 
On another window run the following ./mqttclient.sh ( This will then update the record in the devices table for your pi 
What happens is that mqttclient.sh extracts the host name and publishes an MQTT topic. This is detected by the MQTT broker and piped to a script - mqtt_basic.sh.
mqtt_basic.sh takes the hostname and queries the DB to see if a record with the hostname exists in the devices table.
If it finds a record exists then it simply updates the lastseen field otherwise it creates a new record

The script is also designed to work natively with Tasmota devices. Simply add your MQTT details to the Tasmota device using the configuration menu.
